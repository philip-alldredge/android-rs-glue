# Usage

## With Docker

The easiest way to compile for Android is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and the
[philipalldredge/cargo-apk](https://hub.docker.com/r/philipalldredge/cargo-apk/) image.

In order to build an APK, simply do this:

```
docker run --rm -v <path-to-local-directory-with-Cargo.toml>:/root/src philipalldredge/cargo-apk cargo apk build
```

For example if you're on Linux and you want to compile the project in the current working
directory.

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/root/src" -w /root/src philipalldredge/cargo-apk cargo apk build
```

Do not mount a volume on `/root` or you will erase the local installation of Cargo.

After the build is finished, you should get an Android package in `target/android-artifacts/debug/apk`.

## Manual usage

### Setting up your environment

Before you can compile for Android, you need to setup your environment. This needs to be done only once per system.

 - Install [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/).
 - Run `rustup target add <target>` for all supported targets to which you want to compile. Building will attempt to build for all supported targets unless the build targets are adjusted via `Cargo.toml`.
    - `rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi`
    - `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android`
    - `rustup target add i686-linux-android`
    - `rustup target add x86_64-linux-android`
 - Install the Java JRE or JDK (on Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk`).
 - Download and unzip [the Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk).
 - Download and unzip [the Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio).
 - Install some components in the SDK: `./android-sdk/tools/bin/sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-29" "build-tools;29.0.0"`.
 - Install `cargo-apk` with `cargo install cargo-apk`.
 - Set the environment variables `NDK_HOME` to the path of the NDK and `ANDROID_HOME` to the path of the SDK.

### Compiling

In the project root for your Android crate, run `cargo apk build`. You can use the same options as
with the regular `cargo build`.

This will build an Android package in `target/android-artifacts/<debug|release>/apk`.

### Compiling Multiple Binaries

`cargo apk build` supports building multiple binaries and examples using the same arguments as `cargo build`. It will produce an APK for each binary.

Android packages for bin targets are placed in `target/android-artifacts/<debug|release>/apk`.

Android packages for example targets are placed in `target/android-artifacts/<debug|release>/apk/examples`.

### Testing on an Android emulator

Start the emulator, then run:

```sh
cargo apk run
```

This will install your application on the emulator, then run it.  
If you only want to install, use `cargo apk install`.

To show log run: `cargo apk logcat | grep RustAndroidGlueStdouterr`

# Interfacing with Android

An application is not very useful if it doesn't have access to the screen, the user inputs, etc.

The `android_glue` crate provides FFI with the Android environment for things that are not in
the stdlib.

# How it works

## The build process

The build process works by:

- Using rustc to always compile your crate as a static library by:
    - Creating a temporary file in the same directory as your crate root. This temporary file serves as the crate root of the static library. It contains the contents of the original crate root along with an `android_main` implementation.
    - Injecting some glue libraries in rust, which is used by `android_main` to perform initialization required by the `android_glue` crate and to call the `main` function of your crate.
- Using `ndk-build` provided by the NDK to to build a shared library.
- Linking to the `android_native_app_glue` library provided by the Android NDK. `android_native_app_glue` provides the entrypoint used by Android's `NativeActivity` that calls `android_main`.

This first step outputs a shared library, and is run once per target architecture.

The command then builds the APK using the shared library, generated manifest, and tools from the Android SDK. 
It signs the APK with the default debug keystore used by Android development tools. If the keystore doesn't exist, it creates it using the keytool from the JRE or JDK.
